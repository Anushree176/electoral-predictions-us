## Abstract

This project seeks to utilize a set of analysis tools for investigating voter behavior by studying the past three Presidential Elections' outcomes at State level. The methodology involves the integration of geospatial data with the socioeconomic factors such as race distribution, GDP, education levels, employment rates, which has revealed deeper insights about the demographic impact, along with the existing impacts of race, education, employment, on election results in recent years. By augmenting traditional predictive modeling with geospatial insights, we aim to uncover spatial voting trends, providing a more robust and nuanced understanding of electoral dynamics at the state level.
